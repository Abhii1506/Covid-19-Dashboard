# Covid-19-Dashboard
Covid-19 dashboard is a tracking and visualization application created using HTML, CSS, Javascript and mapbox.
The dashboard plots the coronavirus world statistics in the form of clusters on the world map and incorporates reverse geocoding to get the data for any particular point selected on the map. The data is fetched from an API that gets updated in real-time.
